## 🍲 Sinig... ang?

An endurance minigame where you're a food stall owner having to struggle to keep your sinigang as fresh as it can get throughout an entire day. Cut up and send fresh ingredients to your pot, punch away (and explode) rather nasty stuff thrown at your sinigang, and try not to embarrass yourself in front of your near-non-existent customer base in this fast-paced arcade-style game!
